							<br><br><h2>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo</h2><br><br><p>In 2012, for my first year as a composer for the Bass trombone class of Olivier Devaure at the Conservatoire National de Musique et de Danse de Paris (France), I wanted to write a piece that came out of the ordinary for the end Master Exam of Matthieu Douchet (now solo bass trombone at the Orchestre National de Lyon) . In four movements, this piece has a CD accompaniment, that I recorded myself on the valve trombone, with the help of my colleague Axel Rigaud. I tried to get all the sounds possible out of my instrument, by playing it upside down, full of water, unscrewed, buzzing slapping hitting bashing... Every sound is an analogue recorded sound from my acoustic King 2b valve trombone. (except of course the whispers at the end of the 4th movement ).<br><br>I wanted to share with you the tracks of the accompaniment CD. The SOLO Bass trombone part is played by a midi piano. Of course it is not the best sound, but it can give you an idea of the piece, and maybe inspire you to purchase it and play it at an end exam, recital, concert...<br><br>The level of this piece is Very Advanced. Hope you like it.<br><br>Tracks with melody are also available to listen freely on my Soundcloud Page.<br><br>NOW ON SALES ON MY WEB STORE !! :-)<br><br><br>HERE ARE THE 4 MOVEMENTS WITH MELODIES :</p><br><br><audio controls><source src=".mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio><br><br><audio controls><source src=".mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio><br><br><audio controls><source src=".mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio><br><br><audio controls style="border-bottom: 1px solid white; padding-bottom: 10px;"><source src=".mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio><br><br><br><br><h2>Elégie pour métal sur bouche et peau de doigts</h2><br><br><p>Commissioned by the CNSM de Paris for the end exams of 2013, this piece is for Bass trombone ( or Euphonium ) and String quartet. It is not very long, lyrical, and pleasant to play. It offers the performer the opportunity to show his or her musical qualities, playing in the whole comfortable register of the bass trombone. The cadenza also gives the performer freedom of expression. Like in all of my pieces, short improvisations are always welcome, as I consider this skill very valuable to any musician, from any idiom.<br><br><br>Title in English : "Elegy for metal on mouth and finger skin "<br><br>Available Now, and currently on SALES  in my Web Store  ! ! !<br><br><br></p><p style="border-bottom: 1px solid white; padding-bottom: 10px;">For Intermediate / advanced level</p><br><br><br><h2>Joliv'</h2><br><br><p>This duo for Trombone and Bass Trombone ( also for 2 euphoniums)  was written for Joel Vaisse and Olivier Devaure, both soloists at the Orchestre National de France. It's a really fun piece to play, with irregular measures and nice melodies.<br><br></p><p style="border-bottom: 1px solid white; padding-bottom: 10px;">Available Now, on my Web Store Launching SALES </p></div>
